This is the repository of the training materials of the DAT4.Zero project

Training and knowledge transfer activities are a joint effort of the partners in the consortium and the training and knowledge transfer team, who support and coordinate the planning and organisation activities, providing an activity and training material overview. 

Early in the project, we established a shared knowledge foundation among the project partners. Then, we combined insights and outcomes from project tasks and collaborative efforts among partners in presentations, training sessions, and demonstrations. In the final phase, we transmitted the consolidated knowledge and technical solutions to the predetermined target audiences and stakeholders, which can be further deployed post-project as part of the project exploitation. 

We have conducted various training activities at different levels from generic knowledge foundation such as the trainings on “Design of Experiment”, on “Supplier Management Process for ZDM”, to DAT4.ZERO solution-oriented training sessions and technology transfer such as the trainings on “in-line measurements of aluminium profile​”, “3D Characterisation of cylindrical runout”, “Nerve Edge computing platform”, “Data Management System-DQM-DMS”, etc.
